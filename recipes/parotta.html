			<p class="description">
				Kerala Parotta is a fluffy layered tasty flatbread made from Maida or Atta, also termed a 'flaky
				textured
				ribbon pancake'.
				This is a very popular dish commonly available in Kerala and other regions in India.
				This is a yummy favorite sold by street vendors and the dish is usually cherished with a spicy chicken,
				beef or mutton curry.
				It is kneading that makes Kerala Paratha soft and flaky. The multiple layers of twisted and folded
				layers
				of Kerala Parotta is indeed a typical sight that you will love.
				Both the young as well as the elderly love the dish.
				Hot fluffy Kerala Parotta is something that should never be missed.
