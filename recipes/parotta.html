	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>
		Kerala Parotta is a fluffy layered tasty flatbread made from Maida or Atta, also termed a 'flaky textured ribbon
		pancake'.
		<br>
		This is a very popular dish commonly available in Kerala and other regions in India.
		This is a yummy favorite sold by <br> street vendors and the dish is usually cherished with a spicy chicken,
		beef or mutton curry.
		It is kneading that makes <br> Kerala Paratha soft and flaky. The multiple layers of twisted and folded layers
		of Kerala Parotta is indeed a typical sight <br> that you will love.
		Both the young as well as the elderly love the dish.
		Hot fluffy Kerala Parotta is something that should <br> never be missed.
