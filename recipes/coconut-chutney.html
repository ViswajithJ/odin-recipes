	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>
		Coconut chutney originated from the South Indian cuisine.
		It is most often served with breakfast or snack dishes.
		<br>
		In its simplest form, it is made by finely grinding fresh white coconut meat with either green chilies or dry
		red chilies and salt added to it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Chilies lend a bit of heat and spice in the chutney. Garlic or ginger can be added for more savory depth. A
		tempering of oil with crackled <br> mustard seeds, fried urad dal (black gram), crisp curry leaves and
		asafoetida(hing) brings more flavor to otherwise plain coconut chutney.
	</p>
